# DoD Cyber-Sentinel Challenge 2024
Department of Defense Cyber Sentinel Challenge. I placed in the top 15%, 741st out of 5000 competitors. The competition lasted 8 hours.

## Experience
The challenges were not user friendly. Despite the steep learning curve, I was still able to solve 2 challenges. A vast majority of my time was spent in stack overflow forums and interacting with ChatGPT and Microsoft Copilot.

## Skills
`Web Exploitation`
`Digital Forensics`
